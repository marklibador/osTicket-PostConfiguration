<h1>Configuration Steps</h1>


**osTicket Admin Panel Configuration Guide**

**Welcome to osTicket! Let's start setting up your admin panel for efficient support ticket management.**

> **Note***
>**Admin vs Agent:** *Admin Panel is used by the Administrator of the osTicketing System whereas Agent is used by the Workers (Helpdesk Professionals).*

<h3>&#9312;Creating Roles</h3>

>**Note***
>*Roles are the permissions granted to Agents per Department that they have access to. Each Role has a set of permissions that can be checked/unchecked for agents given that Role in association with a Department they have access to. An unlimited number of roles can be created and assigned to Agents with access to various departments.*
- Enter Admin Role through the `Admin Panel`
